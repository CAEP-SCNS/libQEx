## What is QEx?

QEx (pronounced \'kyü-eks\\) is a method for robust quad mesh extraction from Integer-Grid Maps with imperfections.
(Imperfect) Integer-Grid Maps are what is generated by most state-of-the art quad meshing methods such as
QuadCover \[[Kälberer et al. 2007](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01060.x)\] or
our own [Mixed-Integer Quadrangulation](http://www.rwth-graphics.de/publication/44/)
\[[Bommes et al. 2009](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1576246.1531383)\].

Quad extraction is often believed to be a trivial matter but quite the
opposite is true: Numerous special cases, ambiguities induced by
numerical inaccuracies and limited solver precision, as well as imperfections in the
maps produced by most methods (unless costly countermeasures are taken)
pose significant challenges to the quad extractor.

Read our paper if you want to find out why quad extraction is complicated and
how we tackle it or skip ahead and download the source code if you
don't care about the details and just need results.
