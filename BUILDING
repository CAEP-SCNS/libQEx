libQEx uses the cmake build system.

libQEx depends on OpenMesh. If you don't have a copy of OpenMesh yet, get it at
http://openmesh.org/. libQEx depends on version 3 of OpenMesh. As of this
writing you have to build OpenMesh from the svn trunk as version 3 is not yet
available in a pre-packaged form.

If you want to build the unit tests, you also need the googletest framework.
You can get it at http://code.google.com/p/googletest/.

Building libQEx involves the following steps:

# Clone libQEx
git clone https://github.com/hcebke/libQEx.git libQEx
cd libQEx

# Create a build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Initialize the build directory
cmake -D OPENMESH_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/OpenMesh/src \
    -D OPENMESH_LIBRARY_DIR=/path/to/OpenMesh/binaries ..

# Alternatively, initialize the build directory, including the unit tests
cmake -D OPENMESH_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/OpenMesh/src \
    -D OPENMESH_LIBRARY_DIR=/path/to/OpenMesh/binaries \
    -D BUILD_UNIT_TESTS=true -D GTEST_DIR=/path/to/googletest ..

# Build
make

# Build the documentation
make qex_doc

# If you have built the unit tests, execute them
./tests/QEx_tests

# Try the demo program
./demo/cmdline_tool/cmdline_tool --help

# To get started with the API, have a look at the API Doc ...
firefox ./doc/html/index.html

# ... and, even better, at the sources of the command line tool.
vim ../demo/cmdline_tool/main.cpp
